Targeted Projection Pursuit allows the user to explore very high dimensional data in an intuitive and transparent way. This project includes an implementation of TPP that can be run either as a standalone tool, or as a plugin for the popular Weka data mining toolkit.

A good place to start is this [introduction](http://code.google.com/p/targeted-projection-pursuit/wiki/Introduction) to TPP, or this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_projection_pursuit).
