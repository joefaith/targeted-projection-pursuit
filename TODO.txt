TODO

- Save projection / view to arff file

- fix the row sorter bug in the projection table list selection model
- can't seem to move individual points (see ScatterPlotMouseListener.306)
- add proper error logging using Log4J or similar
- when showing series, lines should be colored to show direction
- allow user to grab origin marker to move view of entire data set
- make Rectangle a subclass (or decorator?) of Shape, to give more flexibility in the choice of selector
- drag and drop attributes between retinal (color etc) and spatial (projection) panels, making it explicit that an attribute cannot be used for both
- make projection table pop-out
