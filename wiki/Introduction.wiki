#summary An introduction to TPP for data exploration and visual analysis

Targeted Projection Pursuit (TPP) is an interactive information visualisation technique that allows the user to explore high dimensional data in an intuitive and transparent way. This project includes a plugin package for the [http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ Weka] data mining toolkit. The package itself is available from [http://code.google.com/p/targeted-projection-pursuit/downloads/list Downloads])

For more information start with this [http://targeted-projection-pursuit.googlecode.com/files/Targeted%20Projection%20Pursuit.pptx slideshow] introducing the principles behind TPP and how the interface works; or to this [http://code.google.com/p/targeted-projection-pursuit/wiki/Bibliography bibliography] of papers that make use of TPP.

There's also a very short [http://vimeo.com/17527997 video demonstration] of using targeted projection pursuit for visual analysis, including a demonstration of how it can be used to evaluate clusterings.
